# PDF Testing Guide

## Issue: PDF Files Not Opening

The PDF functionality has been implemented but may need testing with actual PDF files. Here's how to test and troubleshoot:

## Testing Steps

1. **Find a PDF file** on your system (any PDF document will work)
2. **Open the Smart Reader application**
3. **Try opening the PDF** using one of these methods:
   - Click "Open File" and select a PDF file
   - Drag and drop a PDF file into the application
   - Use `Ctrl+O` keyboard shortcut

## Troubleshooting

If PDFs still don't open, check the browser console for errors:

1. **Open Developer Tools**: Press `F12` or right-click and select "Inspect"
2. **Check Console**: Look for any error messages related to PDF loading
3. **Common Issues**:
   - File path issues
   - PDF.js worker loading problems
   - ArrayBuffer conversion issues

## What Should Happen

When a PDF opens successfully, you should see:
- The side panel automatically switches to PDF mode
- PDF viewer interface with navigation controls
- Page counter showing "Page 1 of X"
- Zoom controls and "Fit Width" button
- The PDF content rendered on the canvas

## Features to Test

### PDF Navigation
- **Previous/Next buttons**: Navigate between pages
- **Arrow keys**: Left/Right arrow keys for navigation
- **Home/End keys**: Jump to first/last page

### PDF Zoom
- **Zoom In/Out buttons**: Scale the PDF
- **Fit Width button**: Automatically fit PDF to container width
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: `Ctrl++`, `Ctrl+-`, `Ctrl+0`

### Side Panel
- **Toggle**: Click hamburger menu or press `Ctrl+B`
- **Document switching**: Switch between Markdown and PDF modes

## Debug Information

The application logs PDF loading information to the console:
- "Loading PDF from: [file path]"
- "PDF loaded successfully: X pages"

If you see errors, they will help identify the specific issue.

## Alternative Testing

If you don't have a PDF file handy, you can:
1. Download any PDF from the internet
2. Create a PDF using any PDF generator
3. Use a PDF from your Documents folder

## Expected Behavior

- PDFs should load within 2-3 seconds
- Navigation should be smooth and responsive
- Zoom controls should work properly
- The interface should be intuitive and easy to use

**Note**: The PDF functionality uses PDF.js library and should work with most standard PDF files. If you encounter specific issues, please check the console for detailed error messages.
